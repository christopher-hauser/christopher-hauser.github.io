				<h2>Software development is the nexus <br />

			</header>
			<p>It was during my first few days of coding that I realized programming is just an exercise in theme and
				variations — taking a melody or chord progression from one piece of music, and adapting or expanding on
				it to create something brand new. As I continued to code, it became even clearer to me that this
				newfound passion of mine was a brilliant intersection of critical thinking and expression. That was when
				I knew I wanted to become a software engineer.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>I see coding the same way I see music — most of the time, it's just the culmination of a bunch of ideas
				that are repurposed, adapted, and expanded on to create something brand-new.

			<h2>Here's my story.</h2>
			<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/otsl-pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>Growing up, I spent a lot of time
				on the computer.
				From age 9, when I thought creating PowerPoint presentations on who knows what was literally the coolest
				thing ever, to middle and high school when I
				was staying connected with friends online — playing games, chatting on AIM, or eventually posting on
				each others FaceBook walls. My
				studies led me to pursue music performance, education, and ultimately adminsitration, but tech was what
				always felt like home.
			</p>
			<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/friendsboat.jpg" alt="" /></span>Even though it was always on
				my
				mind, it took me a while to dive into programming.
				How was someone like me, who didn't have a computer science degree, ever supposed to get a job in the
				tech industry? But as soon as I said "screw it"
				and started learning to code on my own, I was hooked. I decided to drop everything I was doing at the
				time — most notably my job
				as the Volunteer Coordinator for a well-known American opera company — to devote my time to honing my
				coding skills and becoming a full-time developer.
				<br />
				<br />
				One intensive software engineering program, 1,000+ hours of writing code, and countless cups of coffee
				later... I'm still loving it. In fact, I love it more each and every day.
