				<h2>Software development is the nexus <br />
					between problem-solving and expression.</h2>
			</header>
			<p>It was during my first few days of coding that I realized programming is just an exercise in theme and
				variations — taking a melody or chord progression from one piece of music, and adapting or expanding on
				it to create something brand new. As I continued to code, it became even clearer to me that this
				newfound passion of mine was a brilliant intersection of critical thinking and expression. That was when
				I knew I wanted to become a software engineer.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>I see coding the same way I see music — most of the time, it's just the culmination of a bunch of ideas
				that are repurposed, adapted, and expanded on to create something brand-new.

			<h2>Here's my story.</h2>
			<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/otsl-pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>Growing up, I spent a lot of time
				on the computer.
				From age 9, when I thought creating PowerPoint presentations on who knows what was literally the coolest
				thing ever, to middle and high school when I
				was staying connected with friends online — playing games, chatting on AIM, or eventually posting on
				each others FaceBook walls. My
				studies led me to pursue music performance, education, and ultimately administration, but tech was what
				always felt like home.
			</p>
			<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/friendsboat.jpg" alt="" /></span>Even though it was always on
				my
				mind, it took me a while to dive into programming.
				How was someone like me, who didn't have a computer science degree, ever supposed to get a job in the
				tech industry? But as soon as I said "screw it"
				and started learning to code on my own, I was hooked. I decided to drop everything I was doing at the
				time — most notably my job
				as the Volunteer Coordinator for a well-known American opera company — to devote my time to honing my
				coding skills and becoming a full-time developer.
				<br />
				<br />
				I attended App Academy, a full-stack software engineering immersive program, where I spent countless hours studying and honing new skills (while drinking countless cups of coffee).
				There, I delved into JavaScript, Python, database management with PostrgreSQL, API Design, and frontend development using React/Redux. I built full-stack projects, both alone and with collaborators (check some of those out <a class="summary-link" href="#two">above</a>),
				and I started truly thinking and working like an engineer.
				<br />
				<br />
				Shortly after completing the program, I was hired as a full-time Software Engineer with a focus on frontend development at <a href='https://nuvalence.io/' target="_blank" class="summary-link">Nuvalence</a>, a consulting company specializing in platform development and product management.
				As it was my first professional engineering gig, I absorbed as much information as I could from my colleagues and got some extremely valuable real-world experience. I spent most of my time at the company working in Angular and TypeScript, specifically on a project with the
				NYS Office of Cannabis Management. I also did some Objective-C mobile development while I was on a short, 2-month contract with ADP. In both engagements, I collaborated with fellow engineers, product managers, and designers on a daily basis,
				regularly reviewed others code while getting feedback on my own, and contributed to team rituals like standups, retrospectives, planning sessions, and more.
				<br />
				<br />
				I'm eager to put the skills I've learned in the tech industry over the past couple of years to use in a brand new role, in addition to the many I bring from my previous career in the arts (if you're interested in that experience, I'd be happy to connect over that too)!
				<br />
				<br />
				Let's make something awesome together.
